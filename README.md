# StarChat
Discord-like real-time chat communicator.

The backend was developed using C# with the .NET 6.0 framework, and the desktop application was built with C# using WPF. MongoDB is used as the database. This project was created to learn about WebSockets, non-relational databases, and native desktop applications.

## What can be done additionaly in this project
- add redis,
- add kafka,
- deploy it on the cloud.

The program allows multiple users to connect to multiple servers. It first loads historical messages and then connects to the serverâ€™s WebSocket to receive new messages in real-time, rather than through API calls.

When a user sends a message, the app transmits the content to the server via the WebSocket, where a new message object is created. Once the message is saved into the database, it is broadcast to every WebSocket connected to that server.
